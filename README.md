# 🛍️ ShopSmart - Product Listing React App

ShopSmart is a modern, responsive product listing web application built with **React**. It fetches products and categories from the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/) and allows users to search, browse, and paginate through available products.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Live Search with Debounce**: Instant product search with 500ms debounce to reduce unnecessary API calls.
- 🗂️ **Category Dropdown Menu**: Interactive hover-based dropdown that fetches categories from the API dynamically.
- 📦 **Paginated Product Listings**: Custom pagination logic to browse through multiple product pages.
- 📡 **API Integration**: All data is fetched in real-time from the DummyJSON API.
- ⏳ **Loading Indicator**: SVG-based animated spinner while fetching data.
- 🛒 **Wishlist & Cart UI Hooks**: Visual placeholders for wishlist and cart functionalities.
- ❌ **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages on fetch failures or empty search results.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Built reusable components such as `Spinner`.
- Implemented **real-time search optimization** with API throttling.
- Practiced **conditional rendering** and clean component architecture.
- Worked with **pagination logic** and UI state syncing.
- Strengthened knowledge of **fetch API**, asynchronous code handling, and error boundaries.
- Applied **responsive and modular CSS** with component-specific styling (`.css` files).
- Understood **UI/UX principles** by integrating hover effects, dropdowns, and intuitive layouts.
